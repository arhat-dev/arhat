# Storage

CSI (container storage interface) is the standard way in Kubernetes to provide storage to workloads, but for some remote edge devices, we want something more lightweighted, which can even survive without any container runtime.

## Puspose

- Use CSI in cluster, translate into simple command execution for `arhat`

## Design

<!-- TODO -->
